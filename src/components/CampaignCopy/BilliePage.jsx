            This campaign was developed as a class project and centers around a
            hypothetical album release for Billie Eilish. I created a full PR
            strategy—including media outreach, event planning, and brand
            collaborations—designed to generate buzz and connect with Gen Z
            audiences. While not affiliated with Billie Eilish or her team, this
            project showcases my ability to craft compelling campaigns and think
            strategically about artist branding and fan engagement.
